## pytemplate

A template for a basic Python package with CI via GitHub actions and a JOSS paper template and action

### Using this template

Some version of the following, starting with the [Purpose](#purpose) section of this README, should be included in the README of your package.  The rest of this [Using this template](#using-this-template) section can be removed after you read it.

#### Building your Python package

The following are things to modify to make your Python package work for you:

- Change the version of your package in `pytemplate/__init__.py` which gets called in your `setup.py` file
- I like to start by installing my package in `develop` model in a clean virtual environment.  You can do this a bunch of ways depending on your preferences. After building my clean virutal environment, I navigate to the root of my cloned directory and run `python setup.py develop`.  Running in develop mode allows you to make changes to your package and execute them on the fly without having to reinstall it everytime.  
- You should now be able to open the Python prompt that you have your virtal environment built in and execute `import pytemplate` successfully.


#### Setting up your quickstarter Jupyter notebook

Assuming that you have your package and Jupyter installed, you can use the quickstarter notebook as a way to introduce folks to the key functionality of your package.  

You can do the following to link your virtual environment to your Jupyter notebook kernel:

- Install `ipykernel` in your virtual environment via:

    ```bash
    pip install ipykernel
    ```
    and run the following:
    ```bash
    ipython kernel install --name "<my-virtual-environment-name"
    ```

    At this point, you should be able to select your virtual environment within your Jupyter Lab environment.

    **NOTE**:  If you make changes to the source code of your package, you will need to restart the Jupyter kernel to have the change take effect in your Jupyter notebook.

#### Building your docs

To start install the following in your Python virutal environment:

```bash
pip install sphinx
pip install autodoc
```

There is no need to initialize Sphinx since I have included prebuilt directories.  However, if you want to know how to do this yourself, you can look up how to run `sphinx-quickstart` from within a prebuild `docs` directory.

All of the documentation is contained within the `docs` directory.  This directory contains the following:

- `Makefile`:  To generate the `build` directory and it's contents for the website for Unix
- `make.bat`:  To generate the `build` directory and it's contents for the website for Windows
- `.nojekyll`:  Used when we generate our documentation website via GitHub Pages to ensure Jekyll is not used.
- `source`:  Directory containing all information to build the website.  This is what is modified by you the user.  All documentation is built using ReStructuredText (.rst).
    - `conf.py`:  The Python file that controls how your documentation is built.
    - `index.rst`:  The blueprint of your website.
    - The following were generated by running the Sphinx autodoc tool to build an API documentation of the package from the docstrings for each class, method, and function:  `modules.rst`, `pytemplate.rst`, `pytemplate.tests.rst`.  These were generated by running:
    ```bash
    sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../pytemplate/
    ```

To generate the documentation website files run the following from the `docs` directory if on a Mac or Linux maching (use the `make.bat` for Windows):

```bash
make html
```

This will build the website here:  `docs/build/html`  You can open this locally by double-clicking the `index.html` file.  Ultimately, the contents of the `docs/build/html` directory will be hosted on a separate `gh-pages` branch as we only want to keep the source docs in the code branches.  To setup a webpage after building your docs, do the following:

- Create a branch named `gh-pages` from what you have on `main`
- In your GitHub repo, navigate to `Settings` -> `Pages` and ensure that `Source` is set to `Deploy from branch` and that `gh-pages` is selected as the branch and that `/root` is the target directory.
- Copy the `docs/build/html` directory somewhere else on your machine (e.g., Desktop)
- Pull your new branch to your local repo via `git pull --all`, navigate to the root directory of your repository, and change branches to `gh-pages` (e.g., `git checkout gh-pages`)
- Remove everything from your repo when on the `gh-pages` branch.
- Copy the contents of the `html` directory you copied into the repo.
- Add an empty file named `.nojekyll` to the root directory with the HTML contents.
- Add, commit, and push this to `gh-pages`.
- Change directories back to `main` or your working branch.

If you navigate back to `Settings` -> `Pages` you will now see your web address that has been deployed.  This repos is:  https://jgcri.github.io/pytemplate/
Copy this address and navigate back the main GitHub repo page (e.g., https://github.com/JGCRI/pytemplate).  Click the gear in the `About` section in the top right of your page, paste in the link to your webpage, and click `Save changes`.

You now have a live documentation web page!  You can build custom sections that you can link to in the main README (these now only contain links to Goggle).

#### Your GitHub Actions

Your tests in the package will run via continuous integration from the `build.yml` action.  This is linked to the badge in your README.

#### Modifying your JOSS paper

I put a sample JOSS paper, bibliography, and figure in a directory named `paper` in the root.  This gets compiled to a PDF file so you can check formatting via this GitHub action:  `.github/workflows/draft-pdf.yml which creates a PDF as an artifact that you can download in the action.
This paper includes sample referencing as well.

### Purpose

`pytemplate` was created to make life easier when creating a new Python package.  It comes prebuilt with the following:
- A Python package
- A prebuilt example test suite
- A sample documentation directory and process using Sphinx
- A sample Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) paper template directory
- A GitHub Action workflow for continous integration (CI)
- A GitHub Action workflow for building a PDF from the JOSS paper directory
- A quickstarter Jupyter notebook to introduce your package
- This README which contains specifics that are needed

### Installation

Since this package is a demo and contains no real code that produces something useful, you can simply use this repository to build your own by selecting it as a `Template` when building a new repository.  Then you can modify the contents to suit your needs.  You can also navigate directly to https://github.com/JGCRI/pytemplate, click the shiny green button that says `Use this template` and be on your way.

However, if you want to play around with this package to get used to how things are arranged, you can clone it locally via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JGCRI/pytemplate.git
```
